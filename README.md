# Roundcube Help Plugin
A plugin for Roundcube v1.1 and later which includes the source documentation from Roundcube (version 1.1 is the latest).

# Installation
1) Unzip the plugin into your Roundcube /plugins directory.
2) Rename the directory to "help".
3) Add "help" to the list of plugins in /config/config.inc.php.
4) Copy the config.inc.php.dist file to config.inc.php and modify to suit your server.

# NOTES:
The Roundcube Help plugin is somewhat context-based.  
If you have added a section, like a Calendar, you'll need to create a correponding section in the plugin.
